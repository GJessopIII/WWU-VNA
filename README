This is some source code for the WWU VNA.  The hardware files can be found at this repository:  
https://github.com/frohro/WWU-VNA

These instructions were done an a Ubuntu Linux computer.  They will vary slightly for Windows or OS X.

Build Instructions:

	- git clone the repository.  
	- Install Code Composer Studio. (This works with CCS 8.2 and 9.0.) 
		- You need the MSP432 Red board library version 5.23.1 or later or you will have build errors.
	- Install Energia, and using Energia's Tools->Boards:->Boards Manager, add the MSP432P401P (red board)
	- Energia uses the Arduino way of handling libraries, and it is easiest to use that as well, because
		CCS knows how to import things better that way.  So in your ~/Energia/libraries folder make 
		folders for each of the libraries.  Mine look like this.
		:~/Energia$ ls -lah libraries

		Inside those make symbolic links to the appropriate files in your git repository.
		For example, 

	- Import Energia Sketch using File->Import...->Energia->Energia Sketch.
	- Be sure to select MSP432P401R as the processor.
	- Right click on the project, and select add files.
		- Add the .cpp, .c, and .h files.
	- Click the hammer to build in CCS.

	- Under languages, select C11 and c++17
	- Under Build Settings->Miscellaneous->Miscellaneous C++ source specific flags add -fpermissive.
